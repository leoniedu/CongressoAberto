== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I added the widget, but nothing shows up =

Check whether the Wordpress.com Stats plugin is installed and active.
You must have at least version 1.2 of WP Stats.

= How can I integrate this plugin in my non-widget-ready theme? =
If your theme supports widgets, you can place the widget named 'Popular Posts' where you want.

If it doesn't, put this code inside the file sidebar.php, in your theme files:

`<?php if (function_exists('WPPP_show_popular_posts')) WPPP_show_popular_posts(); ?>`

Optionally you can add some parameters to the function, in this format:

`name=value&name=value etc.`

Possible names are:

* `title` (title of the widget, you can add tags (e.g. `<h3>Popular Posts</h3>`) default: Popular Posts)
* `number` (number of links shown, default: 5)
* `days` (length of the time frame of the stats, default 0, i.e. infinite)
* `show` (can be: both, posts, pages; default both)
* `format` (the format of the links shown, default: `<a href='%post_permalink%' title='%post_title%'>%post_title%</a>`)
* `excerpt_length` (the length of the excerpt, if `%post_excerpt%` is used in the format)
* `title_length` (the length of the title links, default 0, i.e. unlimited)
* `exclude` (the list of post/page IDs to exclude, separated by commas. Read the following FAQ for instructions)
* `cutoff` (don't show posts/pages with a view count under this number, default 0, i.e. unlimited)
* `list_tag` (can be: ul, ol, default ul)
* `category` (the ID of the category, see FAQ below for info. Default 0, i.e. all categories)
* `cachename` it is used to enable the cache. Please see the FAQ below.

Example: if you want to show the widget without any title, the 3 most
viewed articles, in the last week, and in this format:
*My Article (123 views)* you will use this:

 `<?php WPPP_show_popular_posts( "title=&number=3&days=7&format=<a href='%post_permalink%' title='%post_title_attribute%'>%post_title% (%post_views% views)</a>" );?>`

You don't have to fill every field, you can insert only the values you
want to change from default values.

You can use these special markers in the `format` value:

* `%post_permalink%` the link to the post
* `%post_title%` the title the post
* `%post_title_attribute%` the title of the post; use this in attributes, e.g. `<a title='%post_title_attribute%'...`
* `%post_views%` number of views
* `%post_excerpt%` the first n characters of the content. Set n with *excerpt_length*.
* `%post_category%` the category of the post

= How can I discover the ID of a post/page? =
Log into your admin page, go to **Posts** or **Pages**; go with your mouse
on your post's title, and in your status bar you should see something like
this: http://YOURSITE.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=14
Then **14** is the number you are looking for.

= How can I enable the caching system when using WPPP_show_popular_posts()? =

When you're using `WPPP_show_popular_posts()`, the caching system is not
enabled.
However you can easily enable it adding a `cachename` parameter to your
settings string. You will have something like this:

 `<?php WPPP_show_popular_posts( "title=&number=3&cachename=topposts1" );?>`

where *topposts1* is a name you must choose for your list. This allows you
to have different lists with different caches.


= I have some other issues. How can I get a debug log? =

1. Download [this zip file](http://polpoinodroidi.com/download/plugins/wppp_debug.zip)
1. extract it and overwrite the current `/wp-content/plugins/wordpresscom-popular-posts/wppp.php` file

Now, if you are using WPPP as a widget:

1. Log in to your admin page.
1. Go to Settings -> Popular Posts *DEBUG*
1. youâ€™ll see a long text. Copy & mail it to: frasten AATT gmail DOOTT com

If you are instead using `WPPP_show_popular_posts()` function for non-widget-ready
themes:

1. edit your theme files, replacing your old `WPPP_show_popular_posts` with `WPPP_show_popular_posts_debug` .
1. you'll see the debug text in place of your usual top-posts list.
1. Copy & mail it to: frasten AATT gmail DOOTT com

**IMPORTANT**: Then, for both cases (widget and function) reinstall the
original version of wppp.php.


= I want to translate the plugin in my language! =

Make a copy of the file `language/wordpresscom-popular-posts.pot` of the
plugin, edit it adding your translations, and then send it to:
frasten AATT gmail DOOTT com.

You can take a look to the it_IT translation file if you want.

I'll add your translations to the plugin!
