Sniplets is a generic text insertion plugin.  Use it to manually or automatically insert data, PHP, syntax highlight, and almost anything else!

== Description ==

Sniplets is a generic text insertion plugin with support for an extensible processing framework. At it's simplest this means you can dynamically replace text in your posts with text that may be defined elsewhere, or created by some other module. For example, you can use Sniplets to perform syntax highlighting of files, execute custom PHP code, insert data from a database, and perform all manner of other useful tasks within a standard interface.

* Replace tags in a post with pre-defined text
* Apply processing functions to the pre-defined text to perform additional functionality
* Automatic insertion - data can be made to automatically appear in various places (header, footer, before post, after post, more tag, initialization)
* Custom processors can be written by the user
* Fully localized

Sniplets is available in:

* English
* Belorussian (thanks to [Marcis Gasuns](http://www.fatcow.com))
