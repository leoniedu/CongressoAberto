CHANGES TO MADE TO PAPER FROM APSA VERSION:


Add priors for the PT and DEM on bvoth dimensions (-1,-1),(1,1)
Estimate different positions for in and out of cabinet for each party except these two
Check whether parties that move in and out actually change positions more

Ben says to estimate party/cabinet positions to see whether just those that change status move
One alternative is to estimate two positions (in and out) for all parties that have moved (irrespective of the number of cabinets) to see how much they change position
